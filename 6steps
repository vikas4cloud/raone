-----
We have to create a script (githubapi) to check all this 

1. Have a branch protection rule applied to master that requires at least 1 additional review before it can be merged


curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" -H "Authorization: Bearer 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" -k \https://api.github.com/repos/kosurumuniraja/Helloworld/branches/master/protection


Vikas Account  worked "branch not protected "

curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" -H "Authorization: Bearer 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" -k \https://api.github.com/repos/vikas4cloud/raone/branches/main/protection

2.  Requires status checks to pass before merging (dependant on the PR building)

curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" -H "Authorization: Bearer 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" -k "https://api.github.com/repos/kosurumuniraja/Helloworld/branches/master/protection/required_status_checks"

3. Requires branches to be up to date before merging (dependant on the PR building)
munni dont  have 

4, Enable a dry-run mode which report on the repos that don't currently match the requirements
invalid 

5 Admins should be able to push to master -
curl -X POST -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" -H "Authorization: Bearer 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" -k \https://api.github.com/repos/kosurumuniraja/Helloworld/branches/master/protection/enforce_admins


vikas 
curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" -H "Authorization: Bearer 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" -k \https://api.github.com/repos/vikas4cloud/raone/branches/main/protection/enforce_admins

6 Find stale branches for every repos

curl -k https://api.github.com/repos/kosurumuniraja/Hsbc/branches/master | ./jq '.commit.commit.author.date'

jq need to installs

need to ad the validation logic also  


Combined 1 2 5

curl -X PUT -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" -H "Authorization: Bearer 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" -k https://api.github.com/repos/kosurumuniraja/Helloworld/branches/master/protection  -d '{"required_status_checks":{"strict":true,"checks":[]},"enforce_admins":true,"required_pull_request_reviews":{"required_approving_review_count":1},"restrictions":null}'


in jenkins 
"curl -s -u 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 https://api.github.com/repos/vikas4cloud/${REPO_NAME}/branches/${Branch}/protection", returnStdout: true).trim()

we have to validate the condition if any condition is false then echo the repo name 



---------------------------


curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" -H "Authorization: Bearer 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" -k \https://api.github.com/repos/kosurumuniraja/Helloworld/branches/master/protection


Make sure check all below points via any scrip(groovy) if any condition not satisfied in any repo the repo nams should be published
